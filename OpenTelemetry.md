# 📊 OpenTelemetry Overview & Architecture

## 🧩 What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) (often abbreviated as **OTel**) is an open-source observability framework for **instrumenting**, **generating**, **collecting**, and **exporting** telemetry data like **traces**, **metrics**, and **logs**. It provides a unified standard and SDKs for multiple languages to help developers monitor and understand how applications behave in production.

OTel is a **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** project and is quickly becoming the **de facto standard** for observability across distributed systems.

## ⚙️ Why Developers Use OpenTelemetry

- **Vendor-neutral instrumentation**: No lock-in with APM vendors like Datadog, New Relic, etc.
- **Unified Telemetry (3 Pillars)**:
  - **Tracing** (Distributed Tracing)
  - **Metrics** (Performance Monitoring)
  - **Logging** (Event Logs)
- **Multi-language SDKs**: Support for Python, Java, Go, .NET, JavaScript, etc.
- **Kubernetes-native**: Seamless integration with cloud-native environments.
- **Cost-effective**: Reduce dependency on costly commercial agents.

### 🔄 Key Components:

- **OTel SDKs / Auto Instrumentation**  
  Embed in your app to generate telemetry (manual or auto).
  
- **OTel Collector**  
  A central service that:
  - **Receives** telemetry from apps
  - **Processes** it (e.g., batching, filtering)
  - **Exports** it to one or more observability backends
  
- **Backends**  
  Tools that visualize or store telemetry: Jaeger (tracing), Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards), etc.
