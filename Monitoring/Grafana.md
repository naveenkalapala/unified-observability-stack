#### Data Flow Process
1. **Query Initiation**: User interacts with dashboard or alert rule triggers
2. **Query Processing**: Grafana server processes the query and identifies target data source
3. **Data Source Communication**: Query is sent to appropriate data source plugin
4. **Data Retrieval**: Plugin fetches data from external system
5. **Data Transformation**: Server applies any configured transformations
6. **Visualization Rendering**: Data is formatted and sent to frontend for rendering
7. **User Interaction**: Results displayed in browser with interactive capabilities

## 3. Need for Grafana

#### Modern Data Landscape Challenges
In today's technology-driven world, organizations generate massive amounts of data from various sources including applications, infrastructure, IoT devices, and business processes. The need for Grafana arises from several critical requirements:

1. **Data Consolidation**: Organizations often have data scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to get a unified view of their operations.

2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Modern applications require continuous monitoring to ensure optimal performance and quick incident response.

3. **Scalability**: As systems grow, the need for scalable monitoring solutions becomes crucial.

4. **Cost-Effective Solution**: Open-source nature provides enterprise-grade capabilities without licensing costs.
